# Assembly Programming

This Repository contains some of the code that I did in assembly language.
All the codes are compatible with any linux x86_64 kernal

I have used Netwide Assembler 

**Command to assemble the Program**
nasm -f elf64 filename.asm

**Command to link the object file**
ld filename.o -o filename

**Command to run**
./filename
